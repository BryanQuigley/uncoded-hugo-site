We are pleased to announce that we have successfully migrated from [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), along with a custom-built theme that closely resembles the original WordPress site. Hugo, for those unfamiliar, is a static site generator that operates without the need for PHP or a database. All pages are constructed locally and deployed directly to the site, resulting in faster load times and reduced hosting costs.

As we endeavor to relaunch Unocded, we are exploring the use of open-source software to promote sustainability for our non-profit organization.
