We've got some important updates to share with you regarding our group's event organization and communication. As you may have noticed, we've decided to move away from using Meetup for our events. We've loved the platform and the community it has helped us build, but recently, the cost has become a bit too steep to justify. We believe that our resources are better spent elsewhere to bring you more awesome experiences.

**Important Warning:** Meetup is still showing our recurring event that we last set up, but please do not trust that information. It's very likely inaccurate because we're no longer maintaining it. We don't want any of our community members to be left in the dark or miss out on the fun due to outdated information!

So, what does this mean for you? From now on, please visit our Eventbrite page for the most accurate and up-to-date information on our events. It's a fantastic platform that allows us to continue organizing and promoting our gatherings without breaking the bank. We're excited to see you there!

And don't worry, if we make any significant changes to how we organize our events or run the group, we'll make sure to keep you in the loop right here on the blog. We want to ensure that our community stays informed and engaged.

Last but not least, we'd like to remind you to check out our matrix server! If you haven't already, join us there for real-time discussions, event updates, and connecting with like-minded individuals. It's a fantastic way for us all to stay connected and keep the conversation going.

We're thrilled to continue building this incredible community together, and we can't wait to see you at our next event. Stay tuned to our blog, [Eventbrite page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hacknight-irl-tickets-407221439287), and [Matrix server](https://matrix.to/#/#hacknightlbc:matrix.org) for all the latest happenings.
